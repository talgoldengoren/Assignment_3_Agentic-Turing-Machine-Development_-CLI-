Performance Tests for Agentic Turing Machine
=============================================

This module contains performance and benchmark tests to ensure the system
meets its performance requirements. Tests measure execution time, memory
usage, and throughput for critical operations.

Performance Targets:
- Skill loading: < 10ms
- TF-IDF embedding generation: < 100ms
- Cosine distance calculation: < 5ms
- Full analysis pipeline: < 5 seconds
- Graph generation: < 3 seconds

Test Categories:
1. Timing Tests - Verify operations complete within time limits
2. Throughput Tests - Measure operations per second
3. Scalability Tests - Test with increasing data sizes
4. Memory Tests - Monitor memory usage patterns
