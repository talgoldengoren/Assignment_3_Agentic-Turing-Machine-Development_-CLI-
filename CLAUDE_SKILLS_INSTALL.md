# Installing Agent Skills to Claude Directory

### 📍 Overview

Claude applications (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) automatically load skills from:
```
~/.claude/skills/
```

This guide shows you how to install your agent skills to this directory so they're available across all Claude applications.

3. Make them available to Claude applications

### Uninstall Skills
```bash
./uninstall_skills.sh
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. Develop Skills Locally
```bash
# Create/edit skills in your project
nano skills/english-to-french-translator/SKILL.md

# Test locally
python3 test_agent.py english-to-french-translator "test"
```

### 2. Install to Claude
```bash
# Install skills to ~/.claude/skills/
./install_skills.sh
```

### 3. Use in Claude Applications

**Claude Code:**
- Skills are automatically loaded
- Use them in your coding projects
- No additional configuration needed

**Claude Desktop:**
- Skills available in chat interface
- Claude will detect relevant skills automatically

**Claude API (with skills support):**
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Skills are loaded from ~/.claude/skills/
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    # Skills auto-detected when relevant
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Translate to French: Hello world"
    }]
)
```

### 4. Update Skills
```bash
# Edit skill locally
nano skills/english-to-french-translator/SKILL.md

# Reinstall (overwrites existing)
./install_skills.sh
```

## 🛠️ Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Create directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Copy skills
cp -r skills/english-to-french-translator ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/french-to-hebrew-translator ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/hebrew-to-english-translator ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/translation-chain-coordinator ~/.claude/skills/

# Verify
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Installation

### Check Installed Skills
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
```

Expected output:
```
english-to-french-translator/
french-to-hebrew-translator/
hebrew-to-english-translator/
translation-chain-coordinator/
```

### View Installed Skill
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/english-to-french-translator/SKILL.md
```

### Count Skills
```bash
find ~/.claude/skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l
```
Should show: `4`

## 🎯 Using Installed Skills

### Option 1: Claude Code

1. Open Claude Code
2. Start a new project or conversation
3. Ask Claude to translate something
4. Claude automatically uses your skills!

**Example:**
```
You: "Translate 'Hello world' to French"
Claude: [Uses english-to-french-translator skill]
        "Bonjour le monde"
```

### Option 2: Claude API

```python
import anthropic
import os

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Translate this sentence through French, Hebrew, and back to English: 'The artificial intelligence system can process natural language.'"
    }]
)

print(response.content[0].text)
# Claude will use your installed skills automatically!
```

### Option 3: Your Python Scripts

Your existing scripts still work:
```bash
# Still uses skills/ directory in project
python3 run_with_skills.py --all

# Analysis (local)
python3 analyze_results_local.py
```

---

## 🔄 Update Workflow

When you improve a skill:

```bash
# 1. Edit locally
nano skills/english-to-french-translator/SKILL.md

# 2. Test locally (optional)
python3 test_agent.py english-to-french-translator "test"

# 3. Reinstall to Claude
./install_skills.sh

# 4. Skills updated in Claude!
```

```

### 3. Keep Project and Claude in Sync
```bash
# After pulling changes
git pull
./install_skills.sh  # Update Claude with latest
